                    <p>By continuing, you acknowledge that you have read and understood
                        this Agreement and agree to its terms.</p>
                    <h3>Service Description:</h3>
                    <p>The Pro Lawn provides a variety of professional lawn care
                        services, including mowing, edging, trimming, aeration,
                        dethatching, fertilization, and weed control. Specific services,
                        pricing, and availability may vary depending on your location
                        and needs. You can find more information about our services on
                        our website or by contacting us directly.</p>
                    <h3>Payment:</h3>
                    <p>All payments for services are processed through Stripe, a secure
                        payment gateway. You agree to provide accurate and complete
                        billing information to Stripe. The total cost of your service
                        will be displayed before checkout.</p>
                    <h3>Scheduling:</h3>
                    <p>Once you have purchased a service, we will contact you to
                        schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. We kindly
                        ask that you be available during the scheduled appointment time.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Cancellations and Refunds:</h3>
                    <p>
                        <li><strong>Refunds are available before the service is
                                provided:</strong></li> You
                        may cancel your service and receive a full refund at any time
                        before the scheduled service date, as long as you notify us at
                        least 48 hours in advance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li><strong>No refunds after service is provided:</strong></li>
                        We do not offer refunds for
                        services already performed. This is because we have used
                        resources and incurred costs to complete the service, regardless
                        of your satisfaction. We strive to provide the best possible
                        service and encourage you to communicate any concerns promptly
                        so we can address them before or during the service.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Scope of Work:</h3>
                    <p>Our services are limited to the specific tasks outlined in your
                        chosen service package. We cannot guarantee specific results, as
                        factors such as weather, soil conditions, and existing lawn
                        health can impact outcomes.</p>

                        hereby waive any objection to such jurisdiction and venue.</p>
